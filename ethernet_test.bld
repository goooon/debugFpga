WARNING:NgdBuild:1345 - The constraint <TIMESPEC TS_sys_clk = PERIOD sys_clk_pin
   50000 kHz;> [rtl/udp.ucf(3)] is overridden by the constraint <TIMESPEC
   "TS_sys_clk_pin" = PERIOD "sys_clk_pin" 20  ns HIGH 50 %;> [rtl/udp.ucf(64)].
   The overriden constraint usually comes from the input netlist or ncf files.
   Please set XIL_NGDBUILD_CONSTR_OVERRIDE_ERROR to promote this message to an
   error.
Done...

WARNING:NgdBuild:1440 - User specified non-default attribute value (12.8) was
   detected for the CLKIN1_PERIOD attribute on PLL "u_pll_adv".  This does not
   match the PERIOD constraint value (20 ns.).  The uncertainty calculation will
   use the PERIOD constraint value.  This could result in incorrect uncertainty
   calculated for PLL output clocks.
